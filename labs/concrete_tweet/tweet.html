	<h1>Selected Tweets from Jacy Catlin (@ieatanddrink)</h1>
	
	<h2>Reasons Behind Selections:</h2>
	
	<p>Jacy Catlin is a comedian I originally discovered through twitter. My friends and I all found him humerous and loved reading his tweets. Hallmarks of his comedy include shock value, running jokes or bits, and a dry delivery. Because of this ultra dry sense of humor, he is off putting to some, but for people who enjoy dry humor, I believe he is one of the best at it. I hope you enjoy my selection of tweets, which I have ranked.</p>
